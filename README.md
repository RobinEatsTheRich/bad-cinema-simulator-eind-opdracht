### Introduction
Hello! How quaint of you to drop by on this humble little application.
It has been made as an end assignment for my course at Novi!
And in case you've somehow found this application in a different way:
[You can find the rest of the Git repository here](https://github.com/RobinEatsTheRich/bad-cinema-simulator-eind-opdracht)

You've found yourself in my Bad Cinema Simulator, as the name implies, 
the goal is to emulate a digital movie-going experience.
But worse :)
The idea is that you pick a movie from a list of most popular ones, or search for one manually,
and then sit in your digital cinema room, but oh no! what's this?

Hecklers.

They're shouting through the movie so much, that you can hardly concentrate on this movie! It just looks like a weird cartoon in the background.
And that hat you were wearing because it looked cool actually is just in the way of the screen!
All your snacks are also of the loudest variant so you feel bad for making noise too.

It's a horrible experience.

Had enough? Feel free to exit the digital viewing room, and pick a different movie, who knows, maybe a different movie and a different attire will make all the difference ;)

### System-requirements
Theoretically any device with a browser should do, but boy does it look a lot better on desktop, highly recommend using it on a desktop browser like [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/windows/) or [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)!

### Installation-guide
1. You will need a Javascript IDE, I can personally vouch for [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).
2. On the [github page of this project](https://github.com/RobinEatsTheRich/bad-cinema-simulator-eind-opdracht), click the "< > Code" button
3. Copy that SSH Link.
4. If you use webstorm, go to File -> New -> Project from Version Control.
   (And if you don't use webstorm, I'm not sure how to help you, but if you google "how to import project from SSH key in **[name of your IDE]**" You should find something to help you.
5. Paste that SSH key in the URL, and pick a directory for the project that suits you.
6. Press clone, and trust this project :) if you dare :)
7. You should now see the complete filestructure being opened.
8. Webstorm might already prompt you for this with a button, but make sure to run an NPM Install.
9. If you don't use the prompt button marked "RUN 'NPM INSTALL'",you will need to do so manually.
10. To do that, you need to navigate to the Terminal, located at the bottom of your Webstorm screen.
11. There it should have a flickering cursor where you can type.
12. Type **'npm run install'**
13. It will spend a few minutes downloading everything you need, but once you're able to type in the terminal again, it should be done.
14. If everything has worked, try navigating to the terminal again, and typing **'npm start'** into the terminal to actually start the webpage. This might take a few minutes.
15. If this doesn't work, try **'npm audit fix'** or even **'npm audit fix --force'** that should get rid of most errors.
16. If that still doesn't work, it becomes a bit more complex so either contact me on Git or try googling, all I can tell you.
17. If it does work? Congratulations! It works!

All API keys should already be functional in the code, if not, please contact me.


### Custom-NPM-commands
As far as I'm aware no cool custom commands:(

### Thank you!
